# Common-Issues
"Project Reboot Failed To Download"----- Disable your anti virus and download it again, if that didn't fix it try downloading it on edge while your anti virus is off, It will say something like "this isn't a commonly downloaded file" ----- just keep clicking more then keep.

"It keeps getting removed from my downloads/ disappearing" Disable your anti virus. When ever you restart your pc your anti virus may remove it just make sure to add an exeption in your antivirus settings

"files missing/ 064x" ------ Download the latest version of Reboot and get the [Reboot-Patcher](https://github.com/Auties0O/Reboot-Patcher/tree/5.3.4)
